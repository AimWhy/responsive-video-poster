# Responsive Video Poster
### Responsive poster image for videos to improve performance and allow full control of video placeholders.

Video elements only allow one image as the poster, which is not optimal for performance. This JavaScript plugin uses a standard image tag as the poster. This means standard responsive image techniques can be used to load only the most appropriate image. This also gives full styling control of video placeholders. Performance optimizations are also included for loading of both native and embedded videos.
